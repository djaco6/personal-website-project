            <h2 class = "textHeader" id = "header1">Early Life</h2>

            <p class = "textParagraph" id = "paragraph1">Meeka was welcomed into the Moore home in September of 2005. I and my two brothers were still in elementary school. Meeka was very nervous at first and spent a lot of time hiding under the furniture. But once she was acclimated to her new home we let her outside to explore...</p>
            
            <h2 class = "textHeader" id = "header2">Adventures</h2>

            <p class = "textParagraph" id = "paragraph2">She quickly got into all sorts of trouble in our heavily wooded neighborhood. Once, she got stuck at the top of a neighbor's giant oak tree that was at least 40ft tall. The fire department refused to help, so my dad got a big ladder and tried to get her down but she refused to come to him. Eventually she got up the courage to climb back down, and fortunately survived the descent without injuries.</p>

            <h2 class = "textHeader" id = "header3">Move to Arlington</h2>

            <p class = "textParagraph" id = "paragraph3">After about three years she moved with us to our new house, twenty minutes away in the town of Arlington. When we first arrived she had a grand time exploring the new neighborhood. Once she left for three days, and we were beginning to be seriously worried about her when she returned one night as if nothing had happened. She often climbed onto rooftops and fences, and had many tomcat suitors. Sometimes at night she could be heard fighting other neighborhood cats. But most of her time was spent lounging in the shade and hunting critters in the backyard.

            <h2 class = "textHeader" id = "header4">Later Years and Death</h2>

            <p class = "textParagraph" id = "paragraph4">In 2019 she began having trouble urinating. We took her to the vet and were told she had kidney failure and may only live a few months. But we fed her a special diet, and she recovered her health for several more years before declining in the summer of 2023. When she started having trouble walking my mom decided it was time to say goodbye. She was euthanized on August 19, 2023. Farewell, Meeka! If your spirit lives on, we wish you many trees to climb and birds to chase. </p>
